# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
 This project aims at predicting the survival rate of titanic .Different Algorithms has been used to predict the survival rate among and based upon this we obtained different acurracy.
 The language used is Python and project is build upon Jupyter notebook.
 
 # Dataset Used:
    https://www.kaggle.com/heptapod/titanic
 
 # Libraries Used:
    * Pandas
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * sklearn
    
  # Algorithms Used:
    1:Logistic Regression
    2:SVM
    3:K Nearest Neighbours
    
  # Accuracy Obtained from different algorithms:
    1:Logistic Regression  - 78%
    2:SVM - 73%
    3:K Nearest Neighbours - 70%
    
  # Procedure followed:
      * importing the required libraries
      * Read and input the training and test data from the CSV files
      * Exploring the data for null values 
      * Exploratory analysis to check for the influence of the various features over the output
      * Cleaning the training and test data
      * processing the categorical values and other unwanted features
      * Separating and assigning the features and output parameters for the training and test dataset
      * Fitting the logistic model using the training data
      * calculate the accuracy using evaluation metrics
      * Fitting the SVM model using the training data
      * calculate the accuracy using evaluation metrics
      * Fitting the KNN model using the training data
      * calculate the accuracy using evaluation metrics
      * Use the trained logistic model to predict the survival of passengers in the test data
      * Output the predicted data into a CSV file   

# Result: 
      Logistic Regression gives the best accuracy of 78% .
